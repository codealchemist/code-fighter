# code-fighter
Fight against other developters commanding your hero with JavaScript!

## Notes

`code-fighter` is work in progress!
This is the first sketch on the idea.
We still need to think about lots of stuff.

## TODO

- Think about loading your player (the algorithm that fights aginst other players).
- Think about selecting oponents.
- Think about having multiple maps / games.
- Think about a limited API to be exposed to players.
- Count points.
- Add different kinds of attacks and defenses.
- Add level bots, obstacles, resources.
